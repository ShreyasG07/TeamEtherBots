# What it does? 

Our team at WeCare.ai successfully built and deployed an integrated Artificial Intelligence solution that caters to all needs pertaining to a patient who is diagnosed with a metastatic tumor. WeCare.ai’s website endows an interactive portal for users to explore any information regarding breast cancer. The research team is proud to develop a contextual virtual assistant integrated with the main website that can answer any query regarding breast cancer, from providing information regarding fundamentals of breast cancer to performing symptom analysis of patients, from displaying statistics and visualization plots to conducting virtual counseling session for our users, this know-it-all bot is more than sufficient to resolve any inquiry. Another state-of-the-art solution brewed in WeCare.ai’s kitchen is the tumor classification web-app that can predict the presence or absence of metastatic or invasive ductal carcinoma just by uploading the histopathology image. While designing this product for our clientele, our team only kept one thing in mind: Serving through AI, One Step at a Time.
